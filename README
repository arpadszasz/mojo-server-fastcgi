DESCRIPTION

The release version 1.98 of Mojolicious has dropped FastCGI support because the
code and test quality of the FastCGI code was not conforming to the standards of
the rest of Mojolicious codebase.

This code will now be maintained as a separate distribution, using the same
namespace as before, so installing it alongside Mojolicious should give You the
same functionality as before.


REASONING

Other Mojolicious users and I believe that FastCGI support is still relevant
today so the goal is to have this distribution synced with core Mojolicious and
have the code and the tests improved so that eventually it will be merged back
in core Mojolicious.
